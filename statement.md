# 📄 Project Statement: Student Management Class

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary purpose of the Student class project is to provide a clear, basic, and encapsulated object-oriented representation of a student entity. This project serves as a foundational example for managing personal and academic attributes (ID, name, age, grade) in a simple data model.

## 🚀 Objectives

1.  *Encapsulation:* To define a self-contained unit (Student class) that bundles data (attributes) and the methods (behaviors) that operate on that data.
2.  *Basic Data Management:* To implement core functionalities for creating, accessing, and modifying a student's key properties, such as updating their academic grade.
3.  *Code Clarity:* To provide an easily readable and maintainable class structure using Python's standard conventions, making it suitable as a reference or starting point for more complex systems.
